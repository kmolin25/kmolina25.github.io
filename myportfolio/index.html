				<p>COLLIDING WORLDS</p>
				<p>18" x 24"</p>
				<p>Date: October 29th, 2017</p>
				<p>"Colliding Worlds" is a piece made on 18" by 24" cardboard from an amazon box. Consistent use of ink, marker and chalk, allowed me the freedom to crosshatch and define each part of the piece. Its symbolizes a them of alternate worlds and alien beings pervading on a plane that is wildly different from theirs. Their dark features and the structurally made world both incline to say they are perfectionist ready to infilitrate and make do with another plane of existence to mold their image onto. the white chalky exteririor identifies itself as a pure space, but the black tear and the numbered and written symbols, are made seem that this plane has already been placed under ownership.Unkown to viewer of this picture, a piece of cardboard was taped onto the chalky plane, continuing the idea that the dark hands are adding their ideal visage.</p>

				<p>INSOURCING</p>
				<p>18" x 24"</p>
				<p>Date: November 18th, 2018</p>
				<p>"Insourcing" was a piece I had to make that cultivated all the recent skills I had learned throughout the semester. It was a harrowing process on just figuring out how to begin the project because it was going to be considered as my my final art piece for the class. I settled on the idea of me prodding my head for ideas. I also saw this type of stylization as a mediating form of drawing. Each line was crosshatched and slowly done one by one. It's a calming procedure of slowly adding curved and straight lines in order to create figurative and expressionative form</p>

				<p>OUTSOURCING</p>
				<p>18" x 24"</p>
				<p>Date: November 18th, 2018</p>
				<p>"Outsourcing" is my thought process of creating pieces of work by fist dealing with the subject matter. It symbolizes that constant poking and prodding that comes with making up ideas, and using thoem resourcefully to my liking. it comes up to an arduous and even stressful process, and I am wary each time I do it, as if I'm unsure if the project itself is risky or even dangerous in certain capacities. </p>

				<p>CONSTRUCTION</p>
				<p>18" x 24"</p>
				<p>Date: November 18th, 2018</p>
				<p>"Construction" is me utilizing the ideas that I have chosen in order to illustrate and define the object. This piece was more meditative in practice and I wasn't sure what to expect from over all. The idea was to make it look three dimensional in some way. the curvature of the lines creates these thicker and pronounced curves, giving off the illusion of shadow within the piece. The mutilated hand is me, trying to say that I often disconnect whenever I draw, I put myself in a bubble and put myself in an atmosphere where my attentin is only focused on what I'm striving for.  </p>
